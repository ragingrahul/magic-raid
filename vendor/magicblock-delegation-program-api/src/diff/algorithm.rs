/// Scenarios:

///     - bytes comparison
///       original: o1 o2 o3 o4 ... oN

/// Diff Format:
///
/// Since an account could have modifications at multiple places (i.e imagine modifying
/// multiple fields in a struct), the diff could consist of multiple segments of [u8], one
/// segment for each contiguous change. So we compute these segments of change, and concatenate them
/// to form one big segment/slice. However, in doing so, we lose the lengths of each segment and the
/// position of change in the original data. So the headers below captures all these necessary information:
///
///  - Length of the given changed data (the second argument to compute_diff).
///  - Number of slices: first 4 bytes.
///  - Then follows offset-pairs, for each slice/segment, that captures offset in concatenated diff
///    as well as in the original account.
///  - Then follows the concatenated diff bytes.
///
/// |  Length   | # Offset Pairs  | Offset Pair 0 | Offset Pair 1 | ... | Offset Pair N-1 | Concatenated Diff |
/// |= 4 bytes =|==== 4 bytes ====|=== 8 bytes ===|=== 8 bytes ===| ... |==== 8 bytes ====|====  M bytes =====|
///
/// Offset Pair Format:
///
/// | OffsetInDiffBytes  | OffsetInAccountData |
/// | ==== 4 bytes ===== | ===== 4 bytes ===== |
///
/// where,
///
/// - OffsetInDiffBytes is the index in ConcatenatedDiff indicating the beginning of the slice
///   and the next OffsetInDiffBytes from the next pair indicates the end of the slice, i.e the length of
///   slice[i] is OffsetInDiffBytes[i+1] - OffsetInDiffBytes[i].
///   - Note that the OffsetInDiffBytes is relative to the beginning of ConcatenatedDiff, not
///     relative to the beginning of the whole serialized data, that implies the OffsetInDiffBytes
///     in the first pair is always 0.
/// - M is a variable and is the sum of the length of the diff-slices.
///  - M = diff_segments.map(|s| s.len()).sum()
/// - The length of ith slice = OffsetInDiffBytes@(i+1) - OffsetInDiffBytes@i, as noted earlier.
///
/// ---
///
/// Example,
///
/// Suppose we have an account with datalen = 100:
///
/// ```text
///      ----------------------------
///      |   a 100 bytes account    |
///      ----------------------------
///      | M | A | G | I | ... |  C |
///      ----------------------------
///      | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 99 |
///      ----------------------------
/// ```
///
/// Also, suppose we have modifications at two locations (say u32 and u64), so we have 2 slices of size 4
/// and 8 bytes respectively, and the corresponding indices are the followings (note that these are "indices"
/// in the original account, not the indices in the concatenated diff):
///
///  - | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |                     -- 4 bytes
///  - | 71 | 72 | 73 | 74 | 75 | 76 | 77 | 78 | -- 8 bytes
///
/// In this case, the serialized bytes would be:
///
/// ```text
///  ------------------------------------------------------
///  | len | num |   offsets   |  concatenated slices     |
///  ------------------------------------------------------
///  | 100 |  2  | 0 11 | 4 71 | 11 12 13 14 71 72 ... 78 | OffsetInAccountData
